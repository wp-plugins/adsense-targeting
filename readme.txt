Get the best AdSense Targeting for your Site!

== Description ==

To get better content in your Ads from Google they have invented the AdSense tags, which marks what is relevant text for the ads and what not. The AdSense Targeting plugin will place a beginning tag in front of every post that is displayed and an ending tag at the end of it. In the editor, you will have the possibility to set the ignore tags around some content that you think is not relevant for ads.

The plugin was tested up to WP 3.5 but should work fine with any other version as well.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `adsense-targeting` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Ready, no customization needed

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I use your Ads Easy Plugin and have the tags activated, do I need this plugin? =

No, you don't necessarily need it. But the targeting of this plugin is more accurate and simply better, than what I found on the net (including the method I used in the Ads Easy). My advise would be to disable the tags in Ads Easy and use the AdSense Targeting instead.

= The plugin destroyed my editor, only the HTML part is working =

That was a bug I couldn't encounter myself, because I have all ad-blockers disabled in my testing environment. The name of the TinyMCE plugin was AdSenseTargeting, which gets obviously blocked. Thus, GoogleIgnoreTags now it is and all should be fine.

== Screenshots ==

1. Active button in editor with text selected
2. The shortcode is wrapped around the selection
3. Source code with the AdSense Tags
